# Aquanite Agreement License v1.1

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. **Referencing Code**: Code may be referenced without restriction, provided that the referenced code does not closely resemble the original code specified in PUBLIC.A. This means that while you can refer to the logic and structure of the code, you must ensure that your implementation is sufficiently distinct from the original. This encourages innovation and creativity while respecting the intellectual property of the original authors.

2. **Copying Code with Credit**: To copy the code, it must be explicitly listed in PUBLIC.A, and appropriate credit must be given to the original authors. This includes providing a clear and visible acknowledgment in your project documentation or source files, indicating the original authors and the source of the code. This not only honors the hard work of the original authors but also maintains transparency and integrity within the developer community.

3. **Non-PUBLIC.A Code**: Any code not listed in PUBLIC.A is strictly prohibited from being copied or used in any form. This ensures that only the code explicitly made available for use is utilized, protecting other parts of the software that may not be intended for public use. Unauthorized use of non-PUBLIC.A code is a violation of this license and undermines the trust and legal agreements established by the software's authors.

4. **Modification and Distribution**: You are allowed to modify the code listed in PUBLIC.A and distribute your modifications, provided that you clearly document the changes made and retain the original copyright notice. This helps maintain transparency and gives credit to the original authors while allowing the community to benefit from improvements and adaptations. Proper documentation of changes ensures that the evolution of the software is traceable and that contributors are recognized for their enhancements.

5. **Sublicensing**: You may sublicense the code listed in PUBLIC.A under the same terms as this license. This allows you to integrate the code into larger projects and distribute it under compatible licensing terms. Sublicensing under the same terms ensures consistency and fairness in the use and distribution of the software.

6. **Enforcement and Compliance**: Violations of this license, such as unauthorized copying or failure to provide appropriate credit, will be subject to legal action. Compliance with these terms is essential to maintain the integrity and collaborative spirit of the software development community. By adhering to these conditions, you contribute to a respectful and legally sound environment for software innovation.

7. **Contribution Back**: If you make any modifications or improvements to the code listed in PUBLIC.A, you are encouraged (but not required) to contribute those changes back to the original repository. This fosters a collaborative environment where the software can continuously improve with community input.

##### Example of PUBLIC.A:

- All contents of `./example/example.cpp`
- All contents of `./example/example.hpp`
- Function `plGetSomething` within `./example/example.c`
